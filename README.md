# Center image inside any tag (inline or block)
* First off all, I would like to say that anyone can use this code for free.
* Clone the ripo OR download and extract it.

## How to use??
* Put an img tag inside any block(div) or inline(span) tag.
```html
<div>
  <img src="https://www.xyz.com/my-image.jpg" alt="my image" />
</div>
```
* Give it class asdh-center_image_inside_me
```html
<div class="asdh-center_image_inside_me">
  <img src="https://www.xyz.com/my-image.jpg" alt="my image" />
</div>
```
* Done. It's that simple.

## Default dimentions
* By default, width and height are assigned to be 200px each, which can be modified as per your need. I have even included an example in the code itself.
